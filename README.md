# tinyrenderer

An attempt to complete the [tinyrenderer](https://github.com/ssloy/tinyrenderer) course by ssloy using Go and SDL.

The original course uses C++ and renders to a TGA image. This project uses Go and renders to the screen. This is to allow me add features in future like mouse and keyboard interactions. ie, rotation, zoom, pan, etc.
